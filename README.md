##Snake Game in C++


##Description
Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake to navigate a map, collect food, and avoid obstacles. The snake continuously moves in a specific direction, and the player's objective is to collect as much food as possible without running into walls or the snake's own body. As the snake consumes food, it grows longer, making the game progressively challenging. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by strategically navigating the snake on the board.

##Features
Intuitive arrow key controls to change the snake's direction.
Dynamic food generation on the map.
Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer.
Score tracking to monitor your progress.
Game over screen with the option to restart.
